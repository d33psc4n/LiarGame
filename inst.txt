GAME RULES: 

Simple rules :D 

- If Player1 starts , then PLayer2 will stay face away from the monitor, so that Player1 can control the game. 
- Player1 will receive 10 images, which he has to describe to Player2 (Here's the tricky part: He can lie or tell the truth!)
- It's up to Player2 to tell if what he heard was a lie or truth. 
- If Player2 is right, Player1 marks that as a "y" . In the other case, he writes down an "n"
- At the end , both scores are compared and the winner is declared

Have fun!
