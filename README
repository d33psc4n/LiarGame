Python lie detection game. Nothing needed pretty much, just keep all the files in the same directory. You can add and remove as many pictures as you want in the "Poze" foler. 
Don't change file names. 



LINUX ONLY!! Want it for Windows ? You gotta change some stuff in there... Maybe i will release a Windows version.. soon. 



Have fun! Spot the liar :P
